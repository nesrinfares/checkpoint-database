Support for complex joins and relationships between tables
Slide 4: Comparison: MongoDB vs SQL

Title: Comparison: MongoDB vs SQL
Present a table or a visual representation to compare MongoDB and SQL in various aspects, such as:
Data model: Document-based vs Tabular
Schema: Flexible vs Structured
Scalability: Horizontal scaling vs Vertical scaling
Querying: Rich querying capabilities vs Complex joins
ACID properties: Eventual consistency vs Strong consistency
Use cases: Flexible data structures, unstructured data vs Structured and well-defined data
